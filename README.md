# ðŸ“ˆ Short-Term Stock Price Prediction

> **Internship Project â€” Developers Hub | Domain: AI & ML**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project is part of my internship at **Developers Hub**, in the domain of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning (AI & ML)**.  
The goal is to build a regression model that can predict the **next day's closing stock price** based on historical data using features like `Open`, `High`, `Low`, and `Volume`.

Historical data is fetched using the **yfinance** API, and predictions are visualized to compare actual vs predicted values.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Select a stock (e.g., Apple, Tesla, Google)
- Retrieve historical price data using the `yfinance` library
- Engineer features relevant to short-term prediction
- Train a **Linear Regression** or **Random Forest Regressor**
- Evaluate the model and visualize actual vs predicted closing prices

Example:
```python
import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download("AAPL", start="2022-01-01", end="2023-01-01")
